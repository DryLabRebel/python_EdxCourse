IMB/Edx Python course notes

Course Notes for the IMB python short course

```{python}
print( "hello world" )
```

Again, looks like I should be pretty familiar with all this stuff. I need to start actually coding.

[//]: # ( OK, I think I see the problem now, when I start Rmd. python won't start --- WHY!? )
[//]: # ( Same thing happened when I tried to execute a .py program from the command line -- I need to fix this )

Before I finish this course:

- Get python working (maybe it needs to be running inside a conda environment?)
- Get python scripts executing from the command line

Module 1
--------

Python Basics: 

### types ###

Pretty straightforwards stuff.

integers, floats, strings and booleans.

You can make conversions between types - python is pretty clever - and can even convert strings to integers (assuming the string is an integer), like

```{python}
int('1')
```

Will convert '1', into the integer 1.

Floats to integers drops the decimal, and thus loses information.

You can't convert lettersa and symbols to ints (but what about ACII codes?)

Booleans are either true (1) or false (0).

### Expressions ###

Just basic operations.

Variable assignment

```{python}
my_variable = 1
my_variable:1 # will apparently 'denote' the variable, which I'm wondering how this is different from assignment??
```

More straightforward stuff.

### Strings ###

Each element in a string is indexed by integers, either positive or negative.

String operations are fairly intuitive.

    3 * x == xxx

You cannot 'add' a string, but you can add *to* a string.

`3 + x` -- returns an error

But `'3' + x` -- adds the number '3' to the string

Backslashes `\`, as usual are escape characters.

Slicing can be done using indexes.

```{python}
a = 'the cat in the hat '
a[::2] # Take every second character starting from one -- THIS IS A STRIDE VALUE
# 'tecti h a '
a[0:5:2] # Take from 0 to 5, and return every second character - this is slicing
# 'tec'

"345678".find('3') # Ah I see -- 'return index value of string '3'
```

Module 2
--------

Lists and tuples.


Tuples are ordered lists, defined by parentheses.

Tuples can be made of strings, integers, floats, etc. and any combination of these.

A tuple is always of type: tuple.

Tuples can be sliced and concatenated.

```{python}
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4)
tuple2 = ('cat','dog',5.3)

tuple1 + tuple2 = tuple3

tuple3 =  (1,2,3,4,'cat','dog',5.3)

tuple3[2:4]

# (3,4,'cat')

tuple4 = (5,3.2,9,"letter opener",tuple3)

tuple4[4][5][1]

# o

```

So tuples can be nested. Which is even more powerful than it sounds.

From what I can gather, this is the equivalent of creating a list in R.

We can index down to the atomic level, even within strings.

Lists are like tuples, but mutable.

```{python}

list1 = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982]

list1.extend(["pop", 10])

list1 = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982, "pop", 10]

list1.append(["pop", 10])

list1 = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982, "pop", 10, ["pop", 10]]

list1[3] = "soda"

list1 = ["Michael Jackson", 10.1, 1982, "soda", 10, ["pop", 10]]

del(list1[1])

list1 = ["Michael Jackson", 1982, "soda", 10, ["pop", 10]]

"hard rock".split()

# ["hard", "rock"]
# so \s is the default delimiter then?

"a,b,c,d".split(',')

# ["a","b","c","d"]

# I guess that answers my question

```

OK, interesting.

Aliasing.

```{python}
A=B

```

aliases A with B. When you change anything in list A, it changes in B too.

Cloning:

```{python}
B=A[:]
# Again, it is simply referencing all elements of A
```

This will create an independent clone of A: B. A change in A will not induce a change in A, because they are now independent.
